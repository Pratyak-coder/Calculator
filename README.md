### Simple CLI Calculator

Overview

This is a command-line interface (CLI) calculator written in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The program prompts the user to select an operation and input two numbers, then displays the result. Users can exit the program by typing 'exit'.

Features

Supports four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) with clear error messages.
Prevents division by zero with an error message.
Continuous operation in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

Requirements

Python 3.x

How to Run

Save the script as calculator.py.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using:
python calculator.py

Follow the prompts:

Enter an operation (+, -, *, /) or 'exit' to quit.
Enter two numbers when prompted.
View the result or error message.

Example Usage

Notes

The calculator processes two numbers at a time.
Invalid operations or inputs trigger error messages, and the program continues running.
Division by zero is handled gracefully.
